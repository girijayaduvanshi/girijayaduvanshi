# ✨ Hi, I’m Girija Yaduvanshi 👋  
**Independent Researcher | Observational Astrophysicist | Data & Outreach Enthusiast**

🔭 I explore the sky through photometric variability studies, anomaly detection, and machine learning applications in time-domain astronomy.

## 👁️ Interests  
- Planetary nebulae (NGC 3918 🌀), binary stars (T CrB, Algol-type), exoplanet transits  
- Real-time transient detection with platforms like Lasair  
- ML-driven light curve modeling & anomaly forecasting  
- Citizen science, public engagement, and open data pipelines

## 🛠️ Currently Working On
- 📡 Leading an international AAVSO campaign for **NGC 3918**  
- 🧠 Applying Bayesian statistics and ML to study **Algol & T CrB variability**  
- 🪐 Improving exoplanet transit modeling with EXOTIC + custom Python workflows  
- 🌍 Updating [girijayaduvanshi.github.io](https://girijayaduvanshi.github.io) – my independent research hub

---

## 🤝 I’m open to collaborating on:
- AstronomyPython based projects needing light curve analysis, ML modeling, or campaign coordination  
- Public outreach efforts, blog features, and educational programs  
- Data cleaning, feature engineering, and predictive science for astro-research groups

## ⚡ Fun fact
I’m not affiliated with an institution—but I’ve launched research campaigns, presented at public events, contributed to AAVSO, Slooh, and Lasair, and built a full-stack observational practice from scratch. My telescope is my voice—and I’m just getting started. 🌌- 👋 Hi, I’m @girijayaduvanshi
